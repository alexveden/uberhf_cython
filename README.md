# UberHF Cython

First generation of high-frequency trading framework written in C, Cython and Python.

I decided to rewrite this project completely in pure C. So it's archived now.

**Highlights**
- Micro-service architecture
- ZeroMQ driven, binary protocol communication between apps 
- FIX friendly 
- In-memory shared datafeed
- Smart Order execution (algorithmic order with logic)
